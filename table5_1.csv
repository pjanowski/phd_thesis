        Details of the simulations. Simulation speed is measured on a single NVIDIA GTX780 card for the RNA simulations<comma> and on a Quadro K5000 card for the DNA simulations. Ions are Mg2 + for the DNA crystal and Na+ for the other simulations. Atom counts do not include the “extra points” in the TIP4P/Ew waters.
